# Exam engine

For this project we will write generic tool to pass an examine
or take a psychological test. The user answers series of questions
at the end user sees the scores or final result. It can be the final mark
or sort of category that user belongs to. 

So let's spawn a new stack project and dive into the task.

```
stack new exam-engine
```

It's going to be the CLI application again. User will go over a list of
single choice questions and get results at the end.
