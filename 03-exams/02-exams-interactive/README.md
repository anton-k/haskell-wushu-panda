# Interactive exam engine

Let's make or exam example more user friendly and modern looking.
Instead of dumping question by question to terminal we can
make nice interactive terminal application that redraws itself. 
Enter the [brick](https://github.com/jtdaugherty/brick/).

Let's define our exam engine interface so that 
when user answers the question we clear out the screen and draw the next question.
